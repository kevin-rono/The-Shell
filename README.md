# The Shell

An implementation of the backend of the "abash" shell - a simple shell and baby brother of the Bourne-again shell bash. I implemented the following: execution of simple commands, definition of local environment variables, redirection of the standard input and output, execution of pipelines, execution of conditional commands, subcommands, reporting status by setting the environment variable $, directory manipulation, and other built-in commands.
